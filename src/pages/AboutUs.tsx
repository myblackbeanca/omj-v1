              <div className="prose prose-lg">
                <p>When I first started dealing with this messâ€”endless surgeries, constant jaw pain, and feeling totally wrecked by the medical systemâ€”I looked around and thought, Where are the people like me?</p>
                <p>TMJ isn't exactly dinner table conversation, but honestly? It should be. It's this invisible monster that affects millions, and yet we're treated like we just need a nap or, worse, that it's all in our heads.</p>
                <p>I started Oh My Jaw because I was done feeling invisible. People don't see the daily grindâ€”the jaw locking at the worst times, the relentless pain, the emotional rollercoaster that comes with it. They think you're fine because you look fine. But behind the scenes? My life was literally wired and screwed.</p>
