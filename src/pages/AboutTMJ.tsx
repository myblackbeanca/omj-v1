            <p>TMDs don't come alone‚Äîthey love to bring friends like:</p>
            <ul className="list-none space-y-2">
              {comorbidities.map((item, index) => (
                <li key={index} className="flex items-center">

                  {item}
                </li>
              ))}
            </ul>
            
            <p>Some people deal with temporary jaw issues, while others are stuck in it for the long haul. It can start with an innocent little jaw click‚Äîbut sometimes it spirals into severe, life-altering pain across the face, jaw, and neck. Everyday things most people don't even think about‚Äîlike eating, talking, smiling, laughing, or kissing‚Äîcan become totally unbearable.</p>
            
            <p>And it's not just about the physical pain. TMDs can wreck your social life, relationships, and mental health, leaving you feeling isolated and misunderstood. The worst part? Many people with TMDs are met with eye rolls and invalidation‚Äîwhether from family, friends, or healthcare providers. It's like being stuck in a loop of "But You Don't Look Sick" vibes, which just makes the whole thing worse.</p>
            
            <p>When TMDs are dismissed or misunderstood, it only leads to more suffering for patients‚Äîand it hits everyone around them, too. That's why we need to take this seriously. Ignoring it isn't just inconvenient‚Äîit's harmful.</p>
